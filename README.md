# Standard Library

Includes a few useful libraries written in c++ or c headers

do what you'd like with them

| Header file   | description |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| RandomCollection.h(pp) | stores a collection of items with certain "rarity" for use in rng lootbox type systems |
| Easing.hpp | functions for 1D easing and interpolation, for animations or other things |

there's no licence because idk how to do that
